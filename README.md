# ring0-csg0
A simple csgo project working in ring0

## Information ##
This project has nothing related to VAC or any violation of their Terms and Conditions. This is purely based on Educational purposes. 

## Features ##
This project includes a ring0(kernel) driver which read/writes memory to CS:GO in a way that is undetected by VAC (for now). This driver communicates from kernel space to user space using IOCTL codes. Probably not the best way, but does the job. 

## Project Features ##
The project has only BHOP for now, more coming soon..
